## üöÄ How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thiagodeas/API-curriculum-maker.git
   cd curriculum-maker
   ```

2. Build and run the project:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

3. Prepare your JSON payload and test the API.

You can test the API in **two ways**:

- 1: Using a JSON file with curl:

Copy the JSON example above and save it as sample-curriculum.json in your project folder.

Then run:
```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/curriculum/generate \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   --data @sample-curriculum.json --output curriculum.pdf
```
This command saves the generated PDF locally as curriculum.pdf.

OR

- 2: Copy and paste the JSON directly in Insomnia or Postman:

Open Insomnia or Postman, create a POST request to http://localhost:8080/api/curriculum/generate, set the body type to application/json, and paste the JSON example above directly into the request body.

Send the request and download the returned PDF.
